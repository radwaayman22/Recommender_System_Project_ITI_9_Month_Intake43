# Movie-Recommender-Systems-Project

#### This repository contains a set of UI components for a recommender system. The system is built to recommend Movies for users based on their historical interactions with the movies and the similarity  between movies   . 

## 1. User Interface:

#### The user interface has been built using the Dash framework. This provides a simple and intuitive way for users to interact with the recommender system.
####  The Dash UI components have been designed to provide a user-friendly interface for the system, making it easy for users to select users/movies, view recommendations, and navigate through the recommendation lists.
####  The Dash UI includes two UI pages: User Page and Item Page, which allow users to interact with the system and view recommendations

## 2. Recommender Models:

### a) For User Recommender : Neural Collaborative Filtering(NCF)
### b) For Item Similarity : Jaccard Similarity
